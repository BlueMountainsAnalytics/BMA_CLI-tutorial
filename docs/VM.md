VirtualBox is a free software tool that lets you load so called virtual machines on your computer. A virtual machine like a small pre-configured operating system that you can simply run in a window on your desktop computer or laptop. For example, if you have windows installed on your computer and a virtual machine with linux installed on it you can run this linux on your windows computer in a window just like your internet browser or any other app.
