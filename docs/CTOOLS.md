# Command-line Tools

All operating systems and computers come with a CLI installed, Terminal on Linux and MACOS/OSX, and Shell/Powershell on WIndows systems. However, from a programming and bioinformatics poitn of view some are more useful than others.

The Terminal that comes pre-installed on linux-based systems such as Ubuntu is ready to use and comes with many development and command-line tools installed.

Apple computers with OSX and MACOS installed also come with a Terminal app. Historically, Apple operating systems are also linux-based. However, newer versions lack many development tools and require installation via XCode.

Windows also provides a CLI, the Shell or PowerShell. However, the Windows CLI differs significantly from the Terminal apps provided by the other systems and lacks the common development tools found on linux systems. Therefore, Windows users need to either install a linux-like system, or access a linux computer remotely. 

For this tutorial and the following workshop we will work remotely on a linux computer rented in the cloud. Linux and Apple users will be able to use their Terminal app to connect to the remote linux instance. 

Windows users will need to install another tool. Here, we will use MobaXTerm.
