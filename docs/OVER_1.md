This course is intended to give an overview and good working knowledge for anyone who wants to get into bioinformatics for long-read sequencing data analysis. As an introduction it won't cover advanced tool use or workflows.It will introduce the main steps and standard tools used for long-read data analysis and raise awareness for potential problems and pitfalls.

The general workflow of long-read whole genome sequence analysis can sometimes be iterative, i.e., the assembly process may have to be repeated using different assemblers to find the best possible genome assembly.
