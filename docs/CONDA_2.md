## Installing Conda

For this tutorials, Conda is already installed on your virtual machine. You can confirm this either with the **which** command from the CLI tutorial to see where conda is installed, or you can check it by asking conda for the version installed on your system:

    course_user> conda --version
    conda 4.14.4

However, in case your system does not have conda installed you will see something similar to this which means you would need to install conda.

    course_user> conda --version
    -bash: conda: command not found

In this case, please see the [Miniconda installation](DATA.md#miniconda-installation) instructions.
